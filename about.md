    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>In 2022, I was worrying about climate change on a weekly basis. I was watching an incessant series of natural disasters unfold through short video clips, because Instagram’s algorithm had learned that I couldn’t look away from them. I was in my final year of college, working in research, and I had become disillusioned with the academic establishment’s ability to respond to the unfolding climate crisis. I couldn’t imagine a future where we found a way out.

Two friends came to my rescue. They both noticed my deteriorating mental health. One recommended the book World as Lover, World as Self by Joanna Macy. The other recommended that I start a meditation practice. 

And then the rest of the information in my bio is going to exist outside of the double column formatting. It's going to take up the full span of the page as a continuation of whatever I will write in this part.
