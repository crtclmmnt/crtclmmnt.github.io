<h1>We are living in a Critical Moment.</h1>

The goal of this project is to empower people who are already rising to the occasion of this critical moment, and to give them new skills for responding to the unfolding crises effectively, sustainably, and mindfully. 

The critical moment I’m referencing is not just political or ecological. It is not just an abstract idea, it is also the visceral thing we are all experiencing. Spiritually, it is the moment where we interface with the universe. Philosophically, it is the only real reality. The past is an idea we will never see again. The future is an idea we could be wrong about. The present, the critical moment, is all we have.

Thinking politically and ecologically requires us to think about the past and the future. But getting lost in the past or the future can distract us from engaging with the present: the moment that everything has led to, the moment where every future begins. 

So, how do we fully engage with the critical moment at hand?
