<h1>We are living in a Critical Moment.</h1>

The crises facing us are numerous. Boiling oceans, collapsing ecosystems, a new gilded age, genocide funded with our tax dollars, the rise of techno-feudalism, and so many other horrors.

It’s hard to face all this without falling apart, or turning a blind eye. 

But it’s also not enough to simply witness these things, and to have the right opinions about them. We need skills for staying grounded while confronting these issues. It’s not enough to be on the right side of history. We have a moral duty to win.

We are living in the critical moment. Despite our memories of the past, and our expectations for the future, the present moment is all we have. Learning how to live in this moment is an indispensable skill.

The goal of this project is to empower people who are rising to the occasion of this critical moment. I want to teach you the techniques of meditation and contemplation so that you can organize your communities from a place of stability, confidence, and resilience, so that you can see the world and its problems with clarity and without bias. 

Everything that has ever happened has brought you to the critical moment, the one you are living in. A future where we win starts now.

A meditation practice can make you more present, patient, and disciplined. It can make you less reactive, distracted, and confused. It gives you clarity to see the world without judgement or bias, and helps you reconnect with your role in the world’s ecology.

Whether you’re a long time organizer or fresh on the scene, a meditation practice can help sustain you and make you more effective as you show up for your community.

For these reasons, I offer free mindfulness meditation workshops to community organizations and community organizers.
